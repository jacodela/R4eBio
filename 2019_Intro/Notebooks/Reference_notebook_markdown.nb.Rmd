# Max Planck Institute for Developmental Biology

## Research
The variety of topics investigated by scientists at the MPI for Developmental Biology is extensive, although all subjects have a biological theme. The cutting-edge technology in molecular and cellular biology and computational science available at the institute is enabling scientists to gain increasing insight into cellular and developmental processes. A highly dynamic and interdisciplinary approach is applied from the molecular level to cells, tissues, and the whole organism. [Read more](http://eb.mpg.de/research/)

## Departments of the MPI for Developmental Biology

* **Department 1** - *Protein Evolution*
* **Department 2** - *Biochemistry*
* **Department 3** - *Microbiome Science*
* **Department 4** - *Evolutionary Biology*
* **Department 5** - *Cell Biology*

## Facilities
The core facilities of the MPI for Developmental Biology are:

1. Electron Microscopy
1. Light Microscopy
1. NMR Spectroscopy
1. Genome Center
1. X-Ray Crystallography.

The facilities offer a broad range of methods and techniques and provide a motivating and helpful environment where researchers/users are trained and supported throughout their projects.

## Events
Every other year the institutes of the Tübingen campus invite the general public to their **Open House** or participate in the **TÜFF** (*Tübinger Fenster für Forschung*), a science fair. Scientists participate regularly at events like the „Kinder-Uni“ (*Children's University*), the **Maus-Türöffner-Tag** (open house event for children), as well as in presentations and podium discussions hosted by the MPI for Developmental Biology, FML or the partner institutes.
