# Nonlinear phenotypic variation uncovers the emergence of heterosis in *Arabidopsis thaliana*

## Author summary

Hybrids often grow faster and produce more offspring than their parents. This phenomenon, called hybrid vigour or heterosis, has been extensively exploited in agriculture. Even though several hypotheses have been proposed to explain the genetic basis of hybrid superiority, there is still no unifying model able to accurately predict the extent and amplitude of heterosis. Here, we tested a model based on physiological constraints to explain the emergence of heterosis in the model plant *Arabidopsis thaliana*. Rooted in the mathematical modelling of phenotypic relationships, our study demonstrates that heterosis can be explained simply with the nonlinearity of trait variation. Our model notably predicts the amplitude of heterosis of two performance traits: growth rate and fruit production. We expect that our model can help to understand the physiology of nonadditive inheritance in different species and that it will open new avenues in both theoretical and applied biology.

## Summary statistics

For this section, you will use the `diamonds` data set that comes with the library `ggplot2`; it contains the prices and other attributes of almost several thousand diamonds.


Just run the following chunk of code. Write each answer in its own chunk of code

```{r Load}
library(ggplot2)
diamonds
```

### Question 2

How many entries does the data set has? How many variables are there? What are the classes of the variables?

```{r}
str(diamonds)
d_entries = nrow(diamonds)
d_entries
```

### Question 3

What is the average price of a diamond? How much does the price deviate from the average value?
```{r}
mean(diamonds$price)
sd(diamonds$price)
```

### Question 4

What is the minimum and maximum caratage of the diamonds in the data set? Determine this in two different ways

```{r}
min(diamonds$carat)
max(diamonds$carat)
range(diamonds$carat)
```

### Question 5

How many diamonds are classified as "Ideal" according to the cut? How many as "Fair"?
```{r}
table(diamonds$cut)
```

### Question 6

What color of diamond is the most expensive by median?

```{r}
aggregate(price ~ color, diamonds, median)
```


### Question 7

What is the difference in caratage between the 90th percentile "Premium" diamond and the 90th percentile "Very Good" diamond?

```{r}
aggregate(carat ~ cut, diamonds, quantile, probs = 0.90)
```


### Question 8

How many "Premium" diamonds have color "H"?

```{r}
table(diamonds$cut, diamonds$color)
```


### Question 9 

Create a table of cut and clarity. Of all the IF diamonds, what is the proportion classified as "Fair"? Of all the "Ideal" diamonds, what is the proportion classified as "I1"?

```{r}
tab_dmd = table(diamonds$cut, diamonds$clarity)
prop.table(tab_dmd, 2)
prop.table(tab_dmd, 1)
```
